The strains of constant admissions in residency is no joke. So when I had the chance to look at my residency's admission data, I was curious if our patient census felt as crushing as it actually was. In family medicine, there are no ACGME caps. Our program also did not have the structure, often found in internal medicine programs, of long-call, shart-call, post or Qx call. We admitted and discharged every day we were on wards. 

We spent well over half the year with a census of 20, which passes the sniff test
