A few years ago, Tulane provided us with a [map of recent Tulane Alumni and their residencies](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1AwGPAhlNgdtiVTwrO49VhXKxrEI&ll=36.3227501547167%2C-96.25223873124997&z=5). I wanted to improve upon the map and also learn some <code>R</code> and <code>Leaflet</code>. Here is the result [Tulane Alumni Map](https://whodat-a.shinyapps.io/residency_map/), which, I think, is prettier, but definitely could use some improvement. I also made the names a hot-link that searches Google for their name, which (I think) improves usability marginally.

This was my first attempt at using Leaflet and looking back, I would add a search bar for location, which I may go back and do.
